I am a robotics and computer vision enthusiast currently working as a Project Scientist at the [Indian Institute of Techonology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/). Prior to this I was an undergraduate student at the Department of Electronics and Communication at National Institute of Technology Calicut (NITC). My current research revolves around the fascinating realm of task planning for field robots. I am driven to enhance the autonomy and decision-making capabilities of robots operating in dynamic and unstructured environments. In my previous work, I have delved deep into the intricacies of kinematic and dynamics control for a range of robotic systems, including quadrupeds. These experiences have honed my skills in developing precise control algorithms that enable robots to navigate and interact with their surroundings more effectively. During my undergraduate studies, I undertook a challenging journey of exploration and discovery. My thesis focused on the development of novel techniques for underwater image enhancement. This research not only expanded my horizons in computer vision and image processing but also underscored the significance of robotics in diverse domains. I take immense pride in being recognized as the 'Best Outgoing Student of the Year,' a distinction I received for my outstanding performance and contributions. Additionally, I stood at the pinnacle of academic achievement, securing the top position among all undergraduate programs at the institute.
