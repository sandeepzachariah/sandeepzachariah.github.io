I am a robotics and computer vision enthusiast currently working as a Project Scientist under the mentorship of [Prof. Rohan Paul](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rohanpaul/) and [Prof. P.V.M Rao](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~pvmrao/) at the Indian Institute of Techonology Delhi ([IITD](https://home.iitd.ac.in/)). Prior to this I was an undergraduate student at the Department of Electronics and Communication at National Institute of Technology Calicut ([NITC](https://nitc.ac.in/)). 

My current research revolves around the fascinating realm of task planning for field robots. I am driven to enhance the autonomy and decision-making capabilities of robots operating in dynamic and unstructured environments. During the summer of 2019 and 2022, I got the opportunity to work with [Prof. Sam K. Zachariah](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/samzac) where I delved deep into the mathematical framework behind robotic systems and the various control strategies. I played a pivotal role in deriving the mathematical model and stabilization of quadruped in the stance phase.

My undergraduate thesis focused on the development of novel techniques for underwater image enhancement. I worked with [Prof. Praveen Sankaran](https://ece.nitc.ac.in/archive/index.php?option=com_php&Itemid=66&uname=psankaran) to develop a fusion based method to combine the images produced by two classical image processing methods to improve both the visual and the semantic quality of underwater images. This research not only expanded my horizons in computer vision and image processing but also underscored the significance of robotics in diverse domains. 

I am also proud to be the recipient of the 'Best Outgoing Student of the Year' and 'Er M L Bapna Gold medal', distinctions I received for the outstanding academic performance and contributions in the undergraduate program. Apart from academics, I have a keen interest in musical pursuits, which includes playing the keyboard and guitar.
