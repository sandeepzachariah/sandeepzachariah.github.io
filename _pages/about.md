I am a robotics and computer vision enthusiast currently working as a Project Scientist under the mentorship of [Prof. Rohan Paul](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rohanpaul/) and [Prof. P.V.M Rao](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~pvmrao/) at the Indian Institute of Techonology Delhi ([IITD](https://home.iitd.ac.in/)). Prior to this I was an undergraduate student at the Department of Electronics and Communication at National Institute of Technology Calicut ([NITC](https://nitc.ac.in/)). 

My current research revolves around the intriguing field of leveraging foundation models for embodied AI agents. Prior to this, I was involved in the development of the autonomy stack for field robots where my primary focus was to develop the task planner and world model. During the summer of 2019 and 2022, I worked with [Prof. Sam K. Zachariah](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/samzac) where I worked in the field of mathematical modelling and control strategies of various robotic systems(2R manipulator and quadruped). And, for my undergraduate thesis, I worked with [Prof. Praveen Sankaran](https://ece.nitc.ac.in/archive/index.php?option=com_php&Itemid=66&uname=psankaran) to develop novel image processing techniques for enhancing underwater images. 

I am also proud to be the recipient of the 'Best Outgoing Student of the Year' and 'Er M L Bapna Gold medal', distinctions I received for the outstanding academic performance and contributions in the undergraduate program. Apart from academics, I have a keen interest in musical pursuits and photography.
